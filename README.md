# Glorzo - Build your own music player

> This project is still in early development. Come back later to get more features~

I am building this app just for fun!

> The name `Glorzo` comes from [Rick and Morty](https://aliens.fandom.com/wiki/Glorzo). This species followed Summer's advice, tried to be free and build their own stuff. I use this name for no particular reason~.

# develop

Glorzo is a simple C/S application. Electron is used for Glorzo Player, and Glorzo Server is powered by Node.js.

## Glorzo Server

To use the server, you have to customize your own MySQL source and object storage service.

After that, to start the server:

```
yarn dev:server
```

## Glorzo Player

To start the local development instance:

```
yarn desktop:serve

yarn desktop:start
```
